Quickly jump to a scene, no need to find a scene file and double click it. See `Unity Editor: Go To Scenes...` command in Command Palatte.

### Reveal Unity Speical Folder

Unity has many speical folders, like Application.persistentDataPath, Application.streamingAssetsPath. It's annoying to find and then open them in Windows Explorer/Finder again and again.

And below paths are included now:

* Application.persistentDataPath
* Application.dataPath
